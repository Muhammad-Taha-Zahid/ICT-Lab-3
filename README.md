ASSEMBLY REFLECTIONS:
Assembly requires a large amount of intentional management of how memory is stored and used, requires lots of precision. Registers are manual and given instructions are low level.
Python on the other hand simplifies these issues by managing memory automatically, allowing the programmer to focus on other tasks
PYTHON REFLECTIONS:
Python is faster than assembly because of abstracted memory management and simple syntax.
The features which make Python easier to work with are:
variables not needing explicit declarations or memory handling.
Functions which have reusable logic and simple code.
Loops, allowing for iterations without manual index management.
